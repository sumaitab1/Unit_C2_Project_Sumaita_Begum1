    <h1> Perfecting Your Code! </h1>
    <p> You're almost done! To make sure you have done everything correctly in your code use enhanced text editors. I use the website <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validator.</a> This way any small mistakes you were not able to locate yourself will be found by the website with a small description on what needs to be fixed. This is the final step into perfecting HTML! </p>
    <h1> Congratulations you have reached the end of my tutorial </h1>
