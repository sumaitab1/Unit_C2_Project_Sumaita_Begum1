    <h1>File Paths</h1> 
    <p>
      A file path is the route to locating a file on your computer. 
      <b>An absolute path</b> is the full URL or complete path starting from the root directory, and it points to the exact location of a file or resource. 
      <b>A relative path</b>, on the other hand, is a partial path based on the current directory or location of the webpage. 
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Absolute Path</b></p>
    <ol> 
      <li>It is best to use absolute paths when referring to files that exist outside of your current computer.</li> 
      <li>Absolute paths use the full URL to a file.</li>
    </ol> 
    <p><i>Here is an example of what the code for an absolute path would look like...</i></p>
    <code>&lt;img src="https://www.example.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Example Image" /&gt;</code> 

    <p><b>Relative Paths</b></p> 
    <ol> 
      <li>It is best to use relative paths when referring to files that are on your own current computer or server.</li> 
    </ol>
    <p><i>Here is an example of what the code for a relative path would look like...</i></p> 
    <code>&lt;img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Example Image" /&gt;</code>
